[**Curta Puzzles**](https://curta.wtf/docs/puzzles/overview) is CTF protocol, where players create and solve EVM puzzles to earn NFTs.

## Solving

To solve locally, create a file named `Solution.t.sol` at `test/curta/{network}/{id}` and create a Foundry test contract that imports the setup contract and implement `test_solve`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import {Setup} from "./Setup.sol";

contract Solution is Setup {
    function test_solve() public {
        // SOLUTION GOES HERE.
    }
}
```

To set up solution files for all puzzles, run the following helper script from the root of the repo (won't overwrite anything):

```sh
source script/curta/setup.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> The solution file doesn't have to be named `Solution.t.sol`&mdash;all test files named `*.t.sol` inside `test/curta` are ignored by Git (see [`.gitignore`](../../.gitignore#L28)).

### Verifying solutions

To verify a solution for 1 puzzle, run the following command:

```sh
forge test --match-path "test/curta/${NETWORK}/${ID}"
```

To verify all your solutions at once, run the following command:

```sh
forge test --match-path "test/curta/*"
```
